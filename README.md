# A blog meter written in Go! 

This tool checks if a given blog is garbage or not. 

The criteria is simple, if the blog has 1 or more affiliate links or less than 1000 words and has 2 or more affiliate links then it is considered garbage.

### TODO

- ~~Separate functions into their own relative files~~
- ~~Clean out missed html tag/s~~
- ~~Better word counter~~
- Better link counter
- Make as command line tool
- Handle request errors beautifully
